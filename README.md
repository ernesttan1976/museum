## Why We Choose React?
Based on this analysis, we can conclude that React is a popular choice due to its high job demand(1), ease of learning(2), component-based architecture(5), virtual DOM(4), reactive updates(8), and state management (Redux)(14). React also offers excellent performance (10), simplicity(11), and optional support for Typescript (12), making it suitable for building complex web applications. Additionally, React's mobile framework, React-Native (13), makes it an excellent choice for building mobile apps.

However, React does not offer native support for server-side rendering (15), forms(17), routing(16), CSS utilities(18), UI Component Libraries(19), but these functionalities can be added using third-party libraries such as Next.js, Formik, React Router, Tailwind CSS and Material UI, respectively.

Ultimately, the choice of technology depends on the specific requirements of the project, and we should consider factors such as community support, documentation, and compatibility with existing code. Nonetheless, React's popularity and vast ecosystem make it a solid choice for building modern web applications.

## Conclusion

### Biggest Challenge
Ernest: </br>

Ida: 
- Material UI CSS Style Default Behaviour
- Learning to work in a group using Github
- Managing expectations
- Communicate each other's code

May: 
- Material UI
- Understanding each other's style of code.  
- The use of bcrypt and jsonwebtoken.
- Getting the artwork Information to show when user click on the artwork. 

</br>
Mark: </br>

will find a way to conclude everyone's thought as a whole, for now let's contribute our own thoughts here! :)

### Key Learnings
shall we move the react key learnings here?

Ernest: </br>

Ida: 
- Group Git
- Learnt debugging skills from fellow members
- Material UI - Difficult at first but very powerful tool
- Utilising wireframing, trello to manage a group project
- Model is CRUCIAL

May: 
- The use of Group Git, branches and conflicts during merge.
- Initial planning of the project (wireframes, model schemas, paths and routes), the more detailed the planning, result in a clearer and smoother implementation of the app.
- It is important to aim and focus on completing one specific task at a time.
- React CRUD. 
- User Sign up and Login using bcrypt and jsonwebtoken. 
- Utilization of ternary operator to enable certain user to accessible to certain informations.

## How to Configure MUI Theme?
1. ([Use Theme Generator https://zenoo.github.io/mui-theme-creator/](https://zenoo.github.io/mui-theme-creator/))
2. Set primary and secondary colours.
3. Save the theme object, cut and paste in theme.js.
 
``` jsx 
 import {theme} from './theme.js';
 import { ThemeProvider } from '@emotion/react';
...
...
<ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
        <Router>
          <App />
        </Router>
      </ThemeProvider>
```
## How to adjust margin, padding, etc on each item? (SX PROP)
([Add style to 'sx' prop](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/how-to-customize/#1-one-off-customization))
 m: 4 -> margin of 4 x 8 = 32px,  
  where 8 is the theme.spacing = 8px  
 p: 4 -> padding of 4 x 8 = 32px,  
  where 8 is the theme.spacing = 8px  

 percentages: any number 0 to 1 is considered a percentage  
 width: 0.5 -> width: 50%  

 whole numbers: units of pixels  
 width: 300 -> width: 300px  

``` jsx
<Slider
  defaultValue={30}
  sx={{
    width: 300,
    color: 'success.main',
  }}
/>
```

## Material UI Icons
 Browse, copy and paste from here
([Material UI Icons](https://mui.com/material-ui/material-icons/))

## Material UI Components

### 1. Bottom Navigation -> <BottomNavigation /> ([Docs](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-bottom-navigation/))
![BottomNavigation](./documents/mui-images/BottomNavigation.png)
 
 Navigation bar stuck to the bottom.

### 2. Stepper (aka Carousel) -> <Stepper/> ([Docs](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-stepper/))
![StepperCarousel](./documents/mui-images/StepperCarousel.png)
 
 Plain stepper is having a before and next botton. A stepper linked to an image is a carousel.

### 3. Drawer -> <Drawer /> ([Docs](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-drawer/))
![Drawer](./documents/mui-images/Drawer.png)
 
 Side drawer menu
 
### 4. Menu -> <Menu /> ([Docs](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-menu/))
![Menu](./documents/mui-images/Menu.png)
 
 Menu is a sub-component for drop downs from the navbar.

### 5. Card ([Docs](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-card/))
 
 Card is a 'Paper' element with a shadow and with 'title', 'subtitle' attributes.  
 A Card contains 'Content', 'Action' elements.  
 A Content element consists of 'Typography' and 'Image' elements  
 An Action element contains buttons. Possible to add accordion effect.  
 Very cool element!  

### 6. Grid (aka Flexbox) -> <Grid />([Docs](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-grid2/))
 
 Don't be fooled by the name 'Grid'. It is actually more like a 'Flex'.  
 Parents are tagged with attribute 'container'. Children are tagged with attribute 'item'.  
 It uses 12 columns, similar to Bootstrap.  

### 7. Snackbar (aka Toast) -> <Snackbar/> ([Docs](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-snackbar/))
 
 This looks like a notification toast  

### 8. Skeleton (aka loading placeholder) -> <Skeleton/> ([Docs](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-skeleton/))

For showing a placeholder while waiting for content to load  
 
### 9. List -> <List /> ([Docs](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-list/))

This element is part of a larger element like a menu or it can be a list of images or messages.
