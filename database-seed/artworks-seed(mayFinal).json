  "artworkInformation": "This acquisition was made possible with donations to the Art Adoption & Acquisition Programme. The relaxed poses of the sitters here distinguish this painting from other royal portraits, which are usually more formal. It is set in the interior court palace, and features familiar elements of Burmese palace architecture such as ornate gilded windows and fluted columns inspired by Western architecture. Such portraits were displayed in the living quarters of the wealthy or sometimes at religious ceremonies. Saya Aye was one of the first artists in Myanmar to combine traditional and Western techniques. He studied under the court painter Saya Chone, who pioneered the genre of royal family portraits towards the end of the Konbaung dynasty (1752–1885), the last royal dynasty in Myanmar.",

Vann’s life was only spared by the prison commander Duch so that he could be put to work producing artworks of Pol Pot for propaganda purposes. Vann is shown presenting a portrait and a bust to Duch while a guard scrutinises the scene through a window. Vann uses architectural elements, such as the grid-like window grilles and air vents, to connect the different figures here: Commandant Duch, the artist, the painted portrait, the sculpted bust, and the prison guard are all implicated in the production of propaganda.\n\nVann was one of the few inmates to survive S-21, and is renowned for his chronicles of Khmer Rouge atrocities. Vann includes himself as a subject here, moving the painting beyond mere documentation.",

This work embodies Po Po’s search to break through the confines of fine art at the time. His practice focused on “object-ness,” and directly challenged conventional representational painting.\n\nThis work is part a series of three monochrome paintings shown at Po Po’s first solo exhibition, Untitled, held at the Myanmar Artistic Association Center in Yangon in 1987. This landmark show featured controversial pieces that radically departed from more traditional paintings. During this time, Po Po was an active participant in the artist collective Gangaw Village Art Group. Gangaw’s annual exhibitions were important sites for creative exchange in 1980s Myanmar, which was still closed to the world at the time due to policies implemented by its military government.",

He created this work in 1977 as a political statement against Indonesia’s then-President Suharto’s authoritarian New Order regime. “I bought the pistol crackers and just poured them on a gallery floor. A lot of people then linked my work with militarism, the regime,” the artist once explained.",

Despite the simplified forms, Chen renders the diverse patterns, colours, and textures of the subjects’ clothing in detail.\n\nThis work demonstrates Chen’s propensity for experimenting with various techniques to develop a unique style. His painting style draws from Cubism, which emphasises condensing three-dimensional forms into a single plan, and Fauvism, which prioritises conveying feeling and visual harmony through non-naturalistic colour. Chen’s ease with combining different approaches arose from working in Southeast Asia and specifically Singapore, where artists felt encouraged to explore and advance new visual languages to express a regional artistic identity.",

Before the decade-long clean-up effort was  initiated in 1977, the Singapore River was heavily polluted, bustling with trade and filled with bumboats. Lim’s river views document the changes taking place in the city-state as it experienced rapid urbanisation and industrialisation. \n\nLim Kwong Ling only started learning photography in his thirties when he began taking adult classes taught by Lee Sow Lim and the Photographic Society of Singapore (PSS) in the early 1960s. By the early 1970s, Lim’s focus had shifted from pictorial to documentary photography, reflecting a more realist approach to image-making.",
